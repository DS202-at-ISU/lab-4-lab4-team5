## Reflection and Notes

- **Challenges Faced**: Matching player names with IDs required additional cleaning, as some names included special characters or unconventional formatting.
- **Future Improvements**: Automating the detection and handling of discrepancies in player names will improve accuracy and efficiency.
- **Key Takeaways**: Understanding how to structure web-scraped data to match a predefined schema and combining it with existing datasets for analysis.
